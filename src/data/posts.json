      "text": ["HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. This is an official theoretical meaning. What you need to know straight away that it is NOT a programming language. Pay attention on the definition: “markup language”. A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Confused already? Ok, let's dive a bit deeper into this topic.",
        "First question that you may ask is: what is  the difference between a computer language and a programming language? Why you are not a programmer if you know only HTML? What is the difference from JS or C++? Everything is simple - HTML do not allow you to define behaviour, to program something, even to perform basic calculations. It allows you to determine alignment of certain elements, describe some preferences and that is it. Result of your work is “dummy” after all. Using HTML you can create skeleton of the page. You can put one tag in another, define that one is bigger than the other, put them one after another to create sequence of elements on the page.",
        "Second question is: what is an HTML element? It is everything you see on the page - button, fields to input text in forms, text paragraphs and so on. HTML uses tags to specify most of the elements on the page. Most of the elements (especially interactive) that you see on the page have separate tag. But you easily create your custom one from basic tags, like from empty canvas.",
        "You can look at HTML like it is a body of a car, its windows, doors, hood and so on. But it is empty. You can turn the steering wheel, but the car wheels are going to stay still. JS is the engine of the car, all electronic parts, magnitola, ect. And let's not forget about CSS. With HTML and JS your car have frame, that protects you from the world outside, it can move. But it has no color, seats are plastic, without proper cover, the interior of the car is simple and minimalistic. CSS adds colors, beautiful and striking curves, spinning wheel rims, lights in the interior and much more.",

      "text": ["Social Media tag and HTML tag are two different concepts. First one is a hashtag - hash symbol (#) + some text that is used to put anchors and bind your post to a specific topic so people could find it faster. It came directly from programming where it is used in a slightly similar way - to create keyword literals (C, C++...), to create content anchors on the page (HTML) and so on.",
        "HTML tag is different thing. So, you may have a question: what the hell is HTML? If you do not know - just check my previous post, I've provided brief info about it and then come back here to continue. So, the HTML tag is the smallest unit of this language and it is used to create components on the page: buttons, inputs, blocks, images and more. The syntax of it is also different than the syntax of the hashtag:",
        "<button> Submit </button>",
        "Above I've created a button with the text 'Submit' in it. Sometimes tags can have some attributes to add more properties to it. For example, if it is a link tag (<a>), except for inner text we could add URL itself, so, when a user clicks on it, he'll go to the page from URL.",
        "Most of the tags in HTML have its own default properties. As you already know, link by default once clicked will redirect you to a specified url. And you don’t need any JS for it. Or for example element input with property “type=checkbox” will look on the page like a real checkbox that we all have seen. It will have basic styles. And you are gonna be able to check or uncheck it. Of course to read the value of this checkbox in order to change something on the page (open/close new tab on the page), you need to use JS. But you'll get a basic webpage anyway.",
        "That is why the word 'tag' without context means a different thing for developers than for a non-IT person."],

Starting from my very first day as a professional software developer, I’ve been looking for new opportunities and develop my understanding of Front-end in general. And from what I can say is that it if a quickly growing sphere, and now it becomes more and more popular.",
        "What you need to know is that Back-end as a definition appeared much earlier. The term “Front-end” refers to the user interface, while “Back-end” means the server, application, and database that work behind the scenes to deliver information to the user. The front-end is everything involved with what the user sees, including design and some languages like HTML and CSS.",
        "But don’t scope the definition of Front-end to the screen output. It is much more than that. Nowadays we have a bunch of tools that help us to build cool and complicated logic even on the client-side of the site or application. Currently, I’m talking about frameworks and libraries. Remember, Front-end is not only about how it looks. Front-end developer should also know how to build an app to make it fast, progressive and logical. How to avoid vulnerable scripts to get to the backend, how to allow people with disabilities navigate through a site. How to minimize the time of loading a site - this is also a front-end developer task. Each second is important. Simply because potential users just can become anxious while he is waiting just live a site. And it can cost a company a significant amount of money.",

And this is what I like about people in IT: pretty rarely you meet someone who is obstinate or set in their ways. Most of the time I am surrounded by gregarious, inspirational and considerate people, who make me perspective and conscientious every single day. They always try to find a way to make your working experience better, optimize it and receive success.",
        "Likewise, a half a year ago I’ve heard about one technique that helps in your everyday time management and successfully has used it since then. So, if you’re easily distracted or have problems with concentration on one particular task, this is definitely for you.",
        "What is this approach? Well, there are 4 pretty simple rules:",
        "1. Plan your tasks. You need to decide how many things you want to finish in one iteration. Try to decompose them as much as possible to get visible results earlier.",
        "2. Set timer for 25 minutes. This is the most optimal time for continuous work.",
        "3. Start. But remember, you need to concentrate on one task. No talks with colleges, all messengers should be closed. You can turn on some music, it’ll help you to stay focused and ignore people around.",
        "4. Make a break. Just for 5 minutes. And in this couple of minutes, you need to do everything besides work. No tasks even for a minute, only rest.",
        "Make 4 circles and then you can let yourself take a bigger break. Then start again. On my own experience I learned that this method helps to increase your working capacity and decrease fatigue at the end of the day. You can do as many iterations if you want. I personally can do only one for 4 intervals.",
        "This technique is called “Pomodorro” as well as each interval in it. Pomodorro from the Italian word for “tomato”, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that creator of this approach used as a university student.",
        "There are a bunch of different apps on the market, that use this method. You can easily find one that suits you. I use “Tide”. It have preset of sounds to turn on while you are working (like thunder of waves), you also can set timer not only for focusing, but for a quick nap or breath.",

Life from the very beginning develops our skills, endurance, and ability to survive creating a variety of different obstacles. And at this point of view life is also a big competition, where only indifferent, conscientious and inquisitive people can win. This is how everyone thinks, but how true is it in reality?",
        "We spend about 50% of our lives at work or studying. And we all have different working conditions. Some scientists think that a highly competitive environment can help people to work much more productively. Obviously, people who look at their inspirational and perceptive colleagues will perform better, but they still will be the way too far from becoming a tough cookie.",
        "A lot of surveys have proved that fear motivates people much better than anything else. A very little part of the population will do as much to reach a peak of their profession as to not lose their job. And a lot of companies use this psychological aspect to create a certain atmosphere in the office. They increase prestige of the vacancy by rising criteria for employees, hire only the best of them. It builds a highly competitive environment which helps companies get higher numbers through this approach. They very often push employees to put their names forward for some activities to outrun rivals.",
        "However, how good is it for the person itself? We all are aware that constant stress has a very destroying influence on our health and body. Often people who can’t relax at work end up with a professional burnout. And it can strike anyone. Even the most perspective and overambitious person who always was an epitome of the best worker tomorrow can go downhill because of fatigue.",
        "This is the reason why modern companies try to switch to another approach in establishing a professional environment. Of course, when you don’t have competition in the collective it is hard to guarantee that each person is motivated. There might be a lot of couch potatoes who only perform a minimum amount of work to be paid. But a friendly and beneficial atmosphere allows interested in growth people to bloom. Unlike companies with unfriendly conditions, people here volunteer by themselves.",
        "In my humble opinion, a competitive environment is extremely stressful and cannot bring as many benefits for a person as a friendly one. Comparatively, big companies build this environment to get as much as they can from each and every employee, to weed out the weakest one. Overall, people always need to stay away from constant competitions in their lives, need to try to be friendly and open-minded at the work, but still, never forget that everyone around has their personal goals and vested interests. So, we all need to have our wits about us and stay away from people who have an ax to grind."],

As there was a lot of new components I had a bunch of questions about the behavior of certain elements in response to some user actions. And I thought to myself: “What makes website easier for user”? What are the golden rules that any Front-end dev needs to know to improve their own pages and websites.",
        "Here are some tips for you from my personal experience:",
        "1. Always add spinners. Not everywhere, of course. But in the places where you make some requests they are highly necessary to show to the user that you are actually doing something. It can improve performance in a certain way, as user will see that his interaction has caused some actions, he won't press submit button (for example) again and again, making more and more requests.",
        "2. Talk to me. Always “talk” with user. It could be some “?” info popups, error messages and ect. As a spinner, it helps user understand what is going on or what is wrong.",
        "3. Limit user. Yes, it might be a bit confusing, but let me explain. You need to make him go through your functionality in a certain way. So, only allow user to do what he needs to do. For example, if there are no results for some filters on your website, disable button “search” and add some message. User will save 2-5 seconds on it and believe me, this is huge.",
        "4. Make it obvious. This is partially about the previous point. Add placeholders and labels for inputs, add login button in the navigation bar, where the user expects them to be. Be VERY careful with experiments. They might look cool but can damage user experience and your product will fail.",
        "5. 3 click rule. User should get to ANY content on your website in 3 clicks. Obviously, if we are talking about a giant shop website you need to understand that we don’t take into consideration checkout, order journeys and so on. But we still try to make it as fast as possible.",
        "6. Light as a cloud. In pursuit of 3 clicks paradigm you can easily overload your page with content. Try to be smart about it. You still need to leave your pages clear and understandable so user can find required information quicker.",
        "7. Hide and seek. In order to make your page lighter you can hide some content in the popups, modal windows and dropdown menus. It is really nice trick and helps you to organise your content in a really cool way. Just don’t forget about the 3d point.",
